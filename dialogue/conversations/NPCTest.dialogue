Byte: Hello! I’ve never seen you before! Are you new here?
- Where… am I? Who are… you?
	Byte: I’m Byte the firefly! And this is my home. Welcome to Evergrove!
	- Byte?
		Byte: That’s me! But don’t worry! Fireflies don’t bite! Haha! What’s your name?
		- My name is… um…
			Byte: Oh! Don’t worry! I forget things all the time too! You can create a new name instead! What can I call you?
			do GameDialogueManager.action_enter_username()
			Byte: {{GlobalVariables.username}}! That is a great name! 
			- Thank you.
				Byte:  I’m so glad you came to Evergrove, < USERNAME >! We really need your help!
				- My help?
					Byte: Yes! Professor Byte has gone missing, and Evergrove is in trouble! We need a human to help us.
					- Secrets?
						Byte: Yes! But after the great disaster struck, without Professor Byte’s guidance, the archives scattered data across the land. 
						- The great disaster?
							Byte:  Yes! I call it The Wipeout. Now, the bugs roam freely, but their information is lost! All gone!
							-  Is that bad?
								Byte:  It’s horrible! Without this knowledge, researchers and scientists won’t be able to understand or protect all the creatures of Evergrove!
								 - How can I help?
									Byte: You can be a Data Explorer! I can help you learn how! Together, we can restore The Great Archive!
									- That sounds like fun! How do we get started?
										Byte: Professor Byte equipped me with access to the archive so I’m sort of… connected to the database? Even so, my processor was scrambled after The Wipeout.
										Byte: I can share what’s left in my memory of the archive with the BugScanner 3000. It’s in the house over there.
