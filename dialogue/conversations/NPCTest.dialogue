- Nevermind. => END!

~ game_lore
Byte: I’m Byte the firefly! And this is my home. Welcome to Evergrove!
- Byte?
	Byte: That’s me! But don’t worry! Fireflies don’t bite! Haha! What’s your name?
	- My name is… um…
		Byte: Oh! Don’t worry! I forget things all the time too! 
		Byte: I'll call you... {{GlobalVariables.username}}
		Byte: {{GlobalVariables.username}}! Now, that is a great name!!
		- Thank you.
			Byte:  I’m so glad you came to Evergrove, {{GlobalVariables.username}}! We really need your help!
			- My help?
				Byte: Yes! Professor Byte has gone missing, and Evergrove is in trouble! You have to help us!
				- Professor Byte?
					Byte: Yes! Professor Byte was the guardian of the Great Data Archives! 
					Byte: The archive contained data on every bug, beetle, and butterfly in Evergrove! 
					Byte: It was a powerful database that kept track of every species' traits, habits, and secrets.
					- Secrets?
						Byte: So many secrets! But after the great disaster struck, the archives scattered data across the land. 
						Byte:  I call it The Wipeout. Now, the bugs roam freely, but their information is lost! All gone!
						-  Is that bad?
							Byte: [shake rate=10.0 level=6 connected=0]IT'S HORRIBLE![/shake]
							Byte: Without this knowledge, researchers and scientists aren't able to understand or protect the creatures of Evergrove!
							 - How can I help?
								Byte: You can be a Data Explorer! I can help you learn how! Together, we can restore The Great Archive!
								- That sounds like fun! How do we get started?
									Byte: Professor Byte equipped me with access to the archive so I’m sort of… connected to the database?
									Byte: Even so, my processor was scrambled after The Wipeout.
									Byte: I can share what’s left in my memory of the archive with the BugScanner 3000.

~ find_the_scanner
Byte: Go get the BugScanner 3000! It’s on top of that log over there.

	% Byte: Quickly! Find the BugScanner 3000!
	% Byte: The BugScanner 3000 close but I can't pick it up.
